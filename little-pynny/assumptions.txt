a running list of assumptions/notes made during the documentation efforts.
may be tested or verified in the future, and will be marked as such if so.

the http status codes are the same for all endpoints in similar scenarios (ex: all requests w/o params return 400)

404 error code suggests deprecated endpoint if received when calling one of the documented methods

all params are strings (would like to change this to reflect params that are integers as integers)

endpoints with crap scope param:
    1. homepageleaders (playerscope and gamescope required)
    2. leaderstiles (playerscope and gamescope required)
    3. leagueleaders (this one is just 'scope' and therefore can be handled normally)
    4. homepagev2 (playerscope and gamescope required)
